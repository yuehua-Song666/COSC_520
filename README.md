# COSC_520 project

## Folder structure
- scissors_final
The final implementation of scissors (livewire) and related code. It is a standalone python program that can be run from the command line. It contains the code for the GUI.

Tests included in the test.py of this folder.
 
### How to run final implementation though command line
cd scissors_final
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

### Other implementations-attempts before we achieve
- firstImplementation
The first implementation of scissors and related code.

- testSuite1
The first implementation of scissors and related code. But also contains unit tests for the first implementation.
This contains the requirements.txt file for the all implementations aside from the final one.

- testSuite2
Contains some other trials and some more unit tests.

## reasons for why we deserve bonuses :)

- graph construction uses sobel filter to find edges, this is more advanced
- graph construction uses a gaussian filter to smooth the image, this is more advanced
- great design of GUI
- speed up of the program in terms of initiallization
